Task 1
(Part 1) Objective: To assess students' ability to perform data analysis, problem solving, data validation, conditional formatting, and create pivot tables using spreadsheet software.

Instructions:
Read each question carefully.
Use the provided sample data to perform the required tasks.
Not all concepts and tools required for this assessment have been covered in previous classes. Use your ability to research using Google, ChatGPT, or Gemini if you need help with the analysis.
Any remaining confusion will be addressed in the next class.
Submit your completed spreadsheet with all calculations, charts, and answers clearly presented.
Scenario: You are working as an analyst for a ride-sharing app company in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The higher management has requested a detailed analysis of the ride data for the month of May 2024.

Sample Data: The sample data consists of daily ride details for 10 drivers over the month of May 2024. For simplicity, we will provide the first few entries. (check the attached file to find the sample data)

Data Validation:
Ensure that the "Rating" column only accepts values between 1 and 5.
Set up a drop-down list for "Driver ID" with the options D001, D002, D003, D004, D005, D006, D007, D008, D009, D010.
Conditional Formatting:
Apply conditional formatting to the "Total Fare (BDT)" column to highlight fares greater than 4000 BDT in green.
Apply conditional formatting to the "Rating" column to highlight ratings below 4.5 in red.
Calculate Totals and Averages:
Calculate the total number of rides completed by each driver for the month.
Calculate the total fare and total distance for each driver.
Calculate the average rating for each driver.
Pivot Table:
Create a pivot table to summarize the total rides, total fare, and average rating for each driver.
Place the pivot table in a new sheet named "Pivot Summary".
Formulas Usage:
Use the SUM formula to calculate the total fare for the entire month.
Use the AVERAGE formula to find the average fare per ride.
Use the IF formula to create a new column "Performance" that marks a driver as "Excellent" if their average rating is 4.5 or above, and "Needs Improvement" if below 4.5.
Percentage Increase: Calculate the percentage increase in rides and total fare from the first to the last recorded day for each driver.

Create Charts:
Create a line chart showing the trend of total fares over the month.
Create a bar chart comparing the total rides completed by each driver.
Summary Report:
Write a brief summary (100-150 words) analyzing the performance of the drivers over the month.
Discuss trends, significant changes, and potential areas for improvement.
Submission:
Upload your completed Google Sheet to the Google Classroom in the Assessment section.
Provide a Loom or Vidyard video (below 5 minutes) explaining how you completed the assessment.
Ensure your video includes a walkthrough of your analysis, demonstrating your approach to the tasks, and highlighting any research you did to complete the assessment.



(Part-2) Objective: Analyze trips data and create a dynamic dashboard.
Output: A dashboard summarizing insights into trip trends and driver performance.
Calculate the average payment per trip.
Create a pivot table showing the number of trips per day.
Visualize the top 3 drivers based on total trips and average rating.
Identify trip trends based on pickup and drop-off locations.
Create interactive charts and use slicers for dynamic filtering.
Objective: Evaluate driver performance based on earnings and ratings.
Output: A detailed summary table and charts showing driver performance.
Use SUMIFS and AVERAGEIFS to calculate the total earnings per driver and their average ratings.
Create a summary table highlighting the top 3 drivers based on earnings and ratings.
Generate a bar chart to display drivers’ total trips and ratings.
Objective: Analyze the payments made to drivers and company commissions.
Output: A report summarizing the payments to drivers and the company’s commissions with a comparison to trip data.
Calculate the total earnings paid to drivers.
Calculate the total commission earned by the company.
Use functions like VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH to verify if the payments are consistent with the trip data.
